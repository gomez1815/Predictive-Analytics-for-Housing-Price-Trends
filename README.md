# 🏠 House Prices Prediction – Advanced Regression Techniques

This project focuses on building predictive models for housing prices using the popular **"House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"** dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to predict the final price of a home based on various explanatory features.

## 📌 Project Overview

Using data from 1,460 homes, this notebook covers a full data science pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Selection & Training**
5. **Visualization & Evaluation**
6. **Result Summary**

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a set of features describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa, develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict **`SalePrice`** — the property's final price.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python, pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🤖 Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost (optional if included)

## 📈 Key Steps

### 🔧 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Scaling and normalization

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution plots
- Outlier detection

### 🧠 Model Evaluation
- Cross-validation (e.g., K-Fold)
- Performance metrics: RMSE, R² score

## 🗂️ Files

- `Project one.ipynb`: Full analysis notebook
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`: Source data (Kaggle)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gomez1815/Data-Science-project.git
   cd Data-Science-project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   Open `Project one.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## 🏁 Results

The best-performing model (based on RMSE and generalization performance) was **[Insert Best Model Here]**, showing strong predictive ability for unseen housing data.
